## layout

this for sits elements within boxes and how to control their appearness in the page, there is block-level property and in this we can't change the height and weidth but in the inline block we can.
and for the position there is a normal flow (static), relative position, absolute position, fixed position.
floating element  in normal flow and placed it left or right.

* normal flow (static): each block-level element sits on top of the next one. 
* relative position:  moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
* absolute position: the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. 
* fixed position: type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.


**z-index** use to control element sits on the top .
**float** allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right.
