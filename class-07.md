## Domain Modeling

The process to create a conceptual model in code for a specific problem this is the domain modeling 
each model describes entities, attributes and behaviors. object-oriented is referred to  entity that
stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.
To remember how to implement domain models you need to write it by your self.


## Table 
to build the table we use table tag, for the header thead tag to put data under the header use tr tag to creat a row, and to add the content to the row use th tag. 
and thead tag how much you have a column you want. 

## Object

for object we add to object properties and each property have a key and value and in read 6 we had learned how to creat an object.
Now we will learn how to update the object and add key value for createn object.
