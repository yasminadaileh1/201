the articale article explain how to draw a rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves.
we can control also the css and make it color ,strokeStyle , and we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property 
the globalAlpha property can be useful if you want to draw a lot of shapes on the canvas with similar transparency.

gets drawn instead. 

The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:
