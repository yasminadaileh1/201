* text area

### making choice :
* radio buttons

form tag must always carry the action attribute it is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information. we can sent the form by using one of two methods which is *get or post*. And we can add the type of the information by type attribute

## lists, tables and forms
there is three type of list:
* ordered list
* unordered list
* definition list
* I see that there is a task list too.


I think to mange the boxes we have to use height and weidth style and put the size in the element selector and it will be inside the box but I have an issue to margin the boxes in different position, and we can put like border to the box and mange it size as same as the margin and even we can styling the border also we can hide it.Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
