## chapter 2 (List)

there is three type of list:
* ordered list
* unordered list
* definition list
* I see that there is a task list too.

For the ordered list use the ol tag which is short cut for **o**rdered **l**ist and to add item to the list use the li tag ( **l**ist **i**tem).
The Unordered list we use ul tag and for item also il tag.
And the definition list created with the dl tag and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. And it contain dt or/and dd tag, dt tag This is used to contain the term being defined, dd to contain the definition.
The task list [ x ] if we put x inside that mean the task is done, without the x the box wil be empty.

 ## Chapter 14 (Boxes)

 I think to mange the boxes we have to use height and weidth style and put the size in the element selector and it will be inside the box but I have an issue to margin the boxes in different position, and we can put like border to the box and mange it size as same as the margin and even we can styling the border also we can hide it.Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

 ## Chapter 4 (Decisions and Loops)

there are two components to the decision expression and conditional
it is like we have several situation and we need to deal with each situation in particular way and also we can add some function to repeat the decision process until we got our needed answer by using loop for or while. About the if statement it's a check input if this the input we need or not if it's what we need we add a resonse if not we can use the loop staff until we got our needs or make a reponse to the input by using else.
I have read about switch statment and loops
