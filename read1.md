# HTML

# Chapter 1 (Structure)

The structure of any web page is similer to newspaper for an example, it will contain a main heading, subheading, article and images.
**HTML** is about tags, elements &amp; attributes and any page of HTML5 should start with the tag of DOCTYPE html without closing then the html tag, we should know that the html page have two main parts which is the head and the body tags.
The head tag contain the title and if we have meta tags we will talk about it later on, and the body tags can contain many tags like header, main, nav etc..
The tag is two type opening and closing the closing is similer to the opening put with forword slash befor the element.
Attributes give us more information about the element and require to have a name and a value.


# Chapter 8 (Extra Markup)
Their are several different version of HTML, XHTML 1.0, HTML 4 &amp; the HTML 5 which we use now. We can know the type of the HTML from the stating tag in the page, the HTML 5 start with the DOCTYPE html and from this tag we can determain that the HTML5 where used.
We can add a comment by typing a < !-- the comment! -- > and this will not appear in the webpage only when read the code you can see the comment. Also, we have a Class and Id element whcih can used to make something special or easy to control and the Id must be unique and non reusable but the class code we can use it with differnt element. And to make blocked elements we can use < li > tag and for the Inline elements we can use < em > , < b > or < a > tags, inaddition to the div tag we use it to make block level boxes.


# Chapter 17 ( HTML Layout)
The < header > and < footer > elements can be used for the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site, a header or footer for an  individual < article > or < section > within the page. The < nav > element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site. The < article > element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.  The < div > element will remain an important way to group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.
